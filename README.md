# Movie_App

**Movie_App** is a simple, responsive web application that fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. This educational project allows users to explore movies, view their details, and search for specific titles. Below, you'll find an overview of its features and technologies used.

## Features

### Movie Sliders
- The homepage presents users with three sliders showcasing upcoming movies, top-rated movies, and popular movies.
- Hovering over a movie poster reveals a short overview of the film. If the overview is too long, it's truncated with ellipses (...).
- Clicking on a movie poster opens a modal window displaying detailed information about the movie, including its poster, title, release date, rating, and a full overview.
- If available, any videos related to the movie are also displayed in the modal window.

### Search Functionality
- Users can search for movies by entering a movie title in the search bar.
- The search results are displayed in a grid with the same functionality as the movie sliders, allowing users to hover over, click on, and view details for each movie.
- A "No results found" message is displayed if no matching movies are found.

### Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring the web pages.
- SCSS: Styling the user interface with a responsive design.
- JavaScript: Fetching and displaying movie data, managing modals, and enabling dynamic functionality.
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API: Fetching movie data.
- GitHub Pages: Hosting the project for easy access.
